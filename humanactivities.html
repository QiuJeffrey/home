    <h1> Boreal Shield </h1>
	<h2> Human Activity </h2>
	<h3> Industries of the Boreal Shield </h3>
	<p> Forestry, mining, hydroelectric generation, fishing, and recreational resource industries in the Boreal Shield are essential to the economy of Canada. </p> 
	<h3> Forestry Industry </h3>
	<p> Quebec and Ontario&rsquo;s forest industry is majorly based in the Boreal Shield ecozone. </p>
	<h3> Mining Industry </h3>
	<p> The Canadian Shield is referred to as &#8220;the storehouse&#8221;, because it contains about half of all metallic minerals in Canada. Geological activity from ancient times created the minerals in this region: gold, silver, copper, nickel, cobalt, and zinc. In the 1990s, Ontario&rsquo;s mineral production - situated entirely in the Boreal Shield -  generated $4 billion in revenue. </p>
	<h3> Impacts of Industrial Activity </h3>
    <p> Exploiting the minerals of the Canadian Shield can alter the flow of and contaminate nearby streams with hydro dams and diversions. It can also acidify soils and lakes (from mine tailing and smelter emission) and introduce sedimentation and stream disruption (from extensive logging and industrial development). </p>
    <p> Common industrial practices by the forestry industry include suppressing natural forest fires, insect control, clear-cutting, and single-species tree farming. </p> 
	<p> These practices can have great long term consequences for the ecosystem of the Boreal Shield. Acid rain in this ecozone can be very destructive to the sensitive lakes and soil. </p>
    <p> In order to protect this ecozone for future generations, environmentally responsible and sustainable regulations need to be implemented to regulate commercial activities. </p>
    <h3> Cities in the Boreal Shield </h3>
	<p> Hundreds of years ago, the system of waterways in the ecozone facilitated transport during the fur trade. </p>
    <p> Currently, the Boreal Shield contains less than 10% of Canada&rsquo;s population, with approximately 3 million living in the ecozone borders. However, the beauty of the forests and waters of the ecozone attract many outdoor enthusiasts to the region. </p>

	<p> Sudbury is the seventh largest municipality in Canada in terms of area. Historically a large producer of lumber and nickel, Sudbury evolved into the economic, health, and educational core of northern Ontario. It also boasts several parks, tourist attractions, and Laurentian University. </p>
