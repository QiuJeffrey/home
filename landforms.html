    <h1> Boreal Shield </h1>
	<h2> Landforms </h2>
    <h3> The Canadian Shield </h3>
	<p> Canadian Shield rock forms the base of the Boreal Shield, and has a long and eventful history. 
    <p> During the Precambrian era (4.6 billion - 0.6 billion years ago), powerful movements within the Earth’s crust warped, folded, and faulted the Shield. </p>
	<p> Other geological structures were created near or on top of the Shield after its formation. </p>
	<p> Currently, most of the ecozone exists as rolling hills. </p>

    <h3> Glacial Deposits </h3>
	<p> 10 000 years ago during the Pleistocene Epoch (last ice age), the movement of glaciers carried tons of gravel, rock, and sand over the land, faulting the bedrock and causing depressions and glacial deposits in the ecozone. </p>
	<p> This created the various lakes and wetlands present in the ecozone today. </p>
	<p> The water sources for the Churchill, Abitibi, and Nelson rivers are found in the Boreal Shield. </p>
	<p> Precambrian granite bedrock from the Shield is evident in this region. Gneiss, the metamorphic result of granite, is also common in this area. </p>
	<h3> Soils </h3>
	<p> There are three main types of forested soil in Canada: Podzolic, Luvisolic, and Brunisolic. </p>
	<p> Soils in the Boreal Shield are brunisolic, and generally consist of moderately weathered material in forests of high altitudes, as well as a variation of depth and a coarse texture. </p>
	<p> Boreal Shield soils are moderately nutrient rich, although rock outcrops and shallow soils occupy productive forest land. </p>
    <p> The <a href="https://www.soilsofcanada.ca/orders/brunisolic.php">University of Saskatchewan</a> performed a study on various properties of soil types within Canada. </p>
