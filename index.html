    <h2> Overview </h2>
	<p> The Boreal Shield is the largest Canadian ecozone with an area of 1.9 million km&sup2;, making up approximately 20% of Canada. </p>
	<p> It covers a large section of the country, extending from coastal Newfoundland to continental Alberta. </p>
	<p> The Boreal Shield starts in the northern Prairies, stretching westwards through Ontario and southern Quebec up to Newfoundland and Labrador. </p>
	<p> The Boreal Shield is comprised of two major ecosystems within Canada - the overlap of the boreal forest and Canadian Shield - from which it takes its name. </p>
	<p> Great forests, rocky hills, and rushing waters make up the majority of this ecozone. </p>
	<p> Many Canadian symbols can be found in the forests of this ecozone, such as the beaver, moose, woodland caribou, wolf and black bear. </p>
	<p> There is an abundance of water: the Boreal Shield contains 10% of Canada’s freshwater as well as several large lakes and rivers. </p>
