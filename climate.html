    <h1> Boreal Shield </h1>
	<h2> Climate </h2>
	<p> As a result of the massive area of the Boreal Shield, the climate and characteristics vary a lot throughout the ecozone. </p>
	<h3> Latitude </h3>
	<p> The Boreal Shield is situated at approximately 50°N, north of the Tropic of Cancer. Boreal forests, such as those of the Boreal Shield, commonly transition to tundra conditions as they go farther north. The latitude of the ecozone affects the temperature as well as the precipitation in specific regions, where areas closer to the Equator are warmer and have more precipitation than areas farther away. </p>

    <h3> Ocean Currents </h3>
	<p> Most of the Boreal Shield is inland and is not majorly affected by ocean currents. However, the ecozone is surrounded by various bodies of water, such as the Hudson’s Bay, St. Lawrence River, and Great Lakes. Areas within the ecozone near the Great Lakes have modified continental climate, and the Hudson Bay also affects regions in the vicinity.
    <p> The eastern tip of the ecozone on the island of Newfoundland is encompassed by the Atlantic Ocean, and is located where the colder Labrador Current and warmer Gulf Stream combine. </p>
	<h3> Winds and Air Masses </h3>
	<p> Cold air masses forming over Hudson Bay affect the ecozone and introduce higher levels of precipitation. The Westerlies, which cover most of North America, are also prevalent in this situation. </p>
	<h3> Elevation and Relief </h3>
    <p> Elevation and Relief are climate factors that do not have a major effect on this ecozone. This is a result of the low altitude differences throughout the Boreal Shield, whose mountains may have eroded away millions of years ago. </p>
	<h3> Nearness to Water </h3>
	<h3> Western / Central Region  </h3>
	<p> The western part of the ecozone has an annual total of 400mm in precipitation, and experiences continental climate. Long, cold winters and short, warm summers are perpetual within the western side of the Boreal Shield. </p>
	<p> The western side has an average winter temperature of about -15&#176;C, and an average summer temperature of about 17&#176;C. It has an overall temperature range of 32&#176;C. </p>
	<h3> Eastern Region  </h3>
	<p> Newfoundland and Labrador experiences maritime climate. </p>
	<p> Regions in the ecozone near the Atlantic Ocean or Great Lakes see higher levels of precipitation, as well as a more moderate temperature difference because of the properties of bodies of water. They are warmer in the winter and colder in the summer compared to the western side of the Boreal Shield. </p>
	<p> The eastern part of the ecozone has an annual total of 1000mm in precipitation. </p>
